# Coronaries-Arteries-Diseases-Weakly supervised Learning based method 
this porject is supported by Jordan University of science and Technology , alonge side with this project we explored a paper that introduced Multi-instance Learning approach based on Transformer in our mission we Re-design PPGE method for more efficient training by improvig **Convolution with Fast Fourier Transform** which called the method Fast Fourier Postional encoding **FFPE**
